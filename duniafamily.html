<h3>My husband, Jay, grew up in White City, KS and attended White City Schools throughout elementary and high school. He attended Washburn University for 3 years and then transferred to Bethany College, playing baseball at both schools. His degree from Bethany is in Accouning. Jay currently works at Cat Cans in Manhattan, KS. He pumps septic tanks and grease traps. He works hard during the day, officiates sports in the evenings and also helps out around the house. In his free time, he enjoys doing CrossFit and watching his kids in their athletic contests and musical performances. Jay is a devoted father who loves his family very much!
